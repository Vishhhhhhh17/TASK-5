# TASK-5

In Task 5, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python. I started by loading the data and checking its structure, including the number of rows, columns, and missing values. Then, I used summary statistics to understand the data better. I created several visualizations like bar plots, histograms, and heatmaps to find patterns and relationships. These plots helped me see how survival rates differed based on gender, class, age, and fare. For example, I found that women and first-class passengers had higher chances of survival. I also checked how age and fare were distributed and used a heatmap to understand how different features are correlated. Overall, this analysis helped me understand the data deeply and uncover key insights that could be useful for decision-making or building models.
